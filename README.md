## The First Principles

As Wikipedia quotes, "A first principle is a basic proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption"

This is exactly what this website is all about. A place where "We, the community" formulate, collect and collaborate on the first principles across various domains be it science, technology, philosophy, math, management or any other field of study.
